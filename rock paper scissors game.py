#rock paper scissors game
#This is a simple rock paper scissors game that you can play with the computer. The computer will randomly select one of the three options and you will be asked to select one of the three options. The game will then determine the winner based on the rules of rock paper scissors. The game will continue until you decide to stop playing.

from random import randint

#create a list of play options
t = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]

#assign a random play to the computer
computer = t[randint(0,2)]

#set player to False
player = False

while player == False:
#set player to True
    player = input("Rock, Paper, Scissors?")
    if player == computer:
        print("Tie!")
    elif player == "Rock":
        if computer == "Paper":
            print("You lose!", computer, "covers", player)
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "smashes", computer)
    elif player == "Paper":
        if computer == "Scissors":
            print("You lose!", computer, "cut", player)
        else:

        print("That's not a valid play. Check your spelling!")
    #player was set to True, but we want it to be False so the loop continues
